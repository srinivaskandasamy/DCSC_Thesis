Your meticulous attitude to my work had helped me gain a deeper understanding on the subject, and meeting hours were especially invaluable. I also appreciate your swift response in getting the practical setup ready for my thesis work.

I would like to kindly acknowledge Frank De Winkel for his continued support on setting up the practical system. I would also like to thank Kees Slinkman for his insightful ideas and support in building a rectilinear environment.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their moral support during my stay in Netherlands.
